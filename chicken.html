<p>What�s better than a golden baked pie? A soft baked pie with some chicken, cheese, and egg! Otherwise known as quiche. Set in a delicious pastry crust, the dish packs a delicious punch with ingredients like veggies, cheese, mild seasoning, and meat. The French baked dish can either be made as mini bite-sized snacks or as one big pie that can be sliced up and served individually. Either way the dish can be tweaked in a number of ways to suit different palates or even different meals. For example, breakfast quiches that feature breakfast foods like eggs, ham, and the works.

The recipe we�re making today is that of a classic chicken quiche. Easy to make and absolutely scrumptious to gobble, the food makes for an excellent tea time snack. Follow the recipe below to make some quiche at home!
