Tip half of the corn into a food processor with the lemongrass, ginger, curry paste, egg, rice flour and milk. Pulse to a paste, then scrape into a bowl and stir in the remaining corn and lime leaves and season.

<li>STEP 2</li>

For the pickled cucumbers, halve the cucumber lengthways and scrape out the seeds using a teaspoon. Slice into half moons and mix with the onion, vinegar and sugar. Set aside for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, before serving.

To fry the fritters, heat 2cm oil in a big wok or deep frying pan. Spoon in tbsps of fritter batter and sizzle for about 2 minutes on each side until golden, crisp and cooked through. Pile onto paper-towel lined trays and keep warm in a low oven while you fry the rest. Serve hot with bowls of sweet chilli sauce and the pickled cucumber.
