      <h2>Method</h2>
     
      <ol>
<li>STEP 1</li>

Cook the potatoes for 10 minutes in salted boiling water, then cool and grate coarsely.

 

<li>STEP 2</li>

Combine all the fritter ingredients in a large bowl and season well. In a separate bowl, combine the ingredients for the yogurt with 2-3 tbsp of cold water to slacken it to a double cream consistency.

<li>STEP 3</li>

Fill a large frying pan with vegetable oil to a depth of 2cm, and heat until a cube of bread browns in 30 seconds.

<li>STEP 4</li>

Divide the fritter mixture into 16 roughly equal fritters and fry in batches, flattening them a little with a spatula as you do so. Cook for 5-6 minutes on each side, until crisp, golden and cooked through. Drain on kitchen paper and keep warm in a low oven while you fry the rest.

<li>STEP 5</li>

Serve with the harissa and lime yogurt, and a sprinkling of chives.
