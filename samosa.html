<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
<li>STEP 1</li>

Cook the potatoes whole for 15-20 minutes until just tender but not mushy. Drain and cool. Meanwhile, sieve the flour for the pastry into a bowl. Add a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp vegetable oil, and rub the oil into the flour with your hands until it looks like breadcrumbs, then add 4-5 tbsp water and bring together. Knead briefly until it forms a ball, it should be smooth and soft. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.

<li>STEP 2</li>

Peel the cooled potatoes and cut into 1cm cubes. Heat a drizzle of rapeseed oil in a frying pan, add the ginger, green chilli and all the dry spices and cook for 1 minute. Add the cubed potatoes and cook for 3-4 minutes, tossing with the spices in the pan. Add the chopped coriander, peas and 1 tsp salt, and keep cooking for 2-3 minutes on a low heat. The veg should be well coated with spices. Check the seasoning and add a pinch of salt if you like. Remove from heat and cool.

<li>STEP 3</li>

For the beetroot, add 1 tbsp rapeseed oil to a hot pan. Add the nigella seeds and, once they start sizzling, add the beetroot and cook for 2-3 minutes on a high heat. Add all the other ingredients, 1 tsp salt and 100ml water. Cover with a lid and cook on a low heat for 10-12 minutes until tender but not too soft. Leave to cool.

<li>STEP 4</li>

Divide the rested pastry into 6 equal-sized balls. Roll each ball into a circle on a lightly floured worksurface to approximately 15cm diameter, then cut in half. Brush the edges with warm water. Bring the straight edges together to make a cone and fill with a heaped tbsp of the filling. Pinch and seal the open edge with a fork. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.

<li>STEP 5</li>

Heat a pan of vegetable oil 1/3 full to 180C, or until a cube of bread browns in 30 seconds. Deep-fry the samosas, two at a time, for 4-5 minutes until light brown and crisp. Drain on kitchen paper, then transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in a low oven while you fry the rest in batches.

<li>STEP 6</li>

To make the mint chutney, tip all the ingredients into a small blender with a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp water and whizz until smooth. Tip into a bowl.

<li>STEP 7</li>

Mix the kachumber salad ingredients in a bowl with a pinch of salt. To serve, spread some tamarind chutney onto 4 plates. Top with samosas, some mint chutney, beetroot slices and salad on the side.
