<p>The season's best berries bring a color palette of red, purple and blue to star in good-for-you desserts. They're light on calories and heavy on flavor.</p>





<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 cups white grape juice, pineapple juice, guava nectar or apple juice</li>
<li>1-8 ounce can crushed pineapple, undrained</li>
<li>1/2 cup fresh blackberries, raspberries and/or blueberries</li>
<li>1/2 cup sliced fresh strawberries</li>
</ul>




<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
<li>In a blender, combine juice and undrained crushed pineapple. Cover and blend until smooth. Divide blackberries and strawberries among twelve 4- to 6-ounce paper cups or freezer pop molds. Pour blended mixture over the fruit. Cover each with foil.
Use the tip of a sharp knife to make a slit in each of the foil tops. For handles, insert a wooden craft stick or plastic spoon into each cup through the slit. (Or add sticks and cover pop molds.) Freeze about 6 hours or until firm.</li>
