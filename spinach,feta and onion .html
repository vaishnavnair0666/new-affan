<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
<li>STEP 1</li>

Heat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Fry the onion and garlic in a little butter until very soft but not browned, add the spinach and stir until it wilts and any liquid dries off. Tip the mixture into a bowl and add the feta and lemon.

<li>STEP 2</li>

Melt some more butter, brush a sheet of filo and cut it lengthways into 3 strips. Put 2 tbsp of the mix at the top of each strip and fold each over diagonally to make a triangle, then continue to fold over down the length of the pastry. Repeat with the remaining filling and pastry. Arrange the parcels on a buttered baking sheet and brush the tops with more butter. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until they�re golden brown and cooked through.
